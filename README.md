### By _Vanessa Stewart_ & _Mark Tiapkov_

## Description
_This is a web project to practice Bootstrap styling and using forms to gather data that is then processed with functions, conditionals, and jQuery event handlers. The webpage asks users for three lengths of a triangle. It returns a message informing the user whether those sides create a triangle and, if so, whether that triangle is an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle._
